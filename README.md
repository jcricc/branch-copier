# 🧠 Project to AI Helper

**Branch Copier** is a fast and simple desktop tool that helps developers explore their codebase and easily copy file contents or project structure into AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or Claude.

Whether you're debugging, explaining code, or prompting AI to generate new features, this app provides a developer-friendly interface to prepare and copy the exact context you need.

## 🛠 How It Works

### Choose Project Folder

Click the "Choose Project Folder" button to open a local project. The app automatically lists files inside, recursively.

### Filter Files (Optional)

- Use the **Include extensions** field to limit by type (e.g., `.py, .js`).
- Use the **Exclude folders** field to skip directories like `.git`, `__pycache__`.

### Preview & Copy

- Click any file to preview its contents.
- Click **Copy File Contents** to copy its content with the filename as a header:

```python
# src/utils/helpers.py

def example():
    ...
```

### Copy Folder Structure

Use the **Copy Folder Structure** button to copy an indented layout like:

```plaintext
project/
  main.py
  utils/
    helpers.py
    data.py
```

## 🧠 Why This Tool?

Most AI tools respond best with:

- Clear file names
- Clean source content
- Compact structure previews

This app is designed to make gathering and formatting that context effortless.

---

## 📎 Roadmap Ideas

- Add extension auto-detection with quick toggle chips
- Right-click context menu for file actions
- File search bar
- Zip export or multi-file copy
- Save/share a full AI prompt pack
